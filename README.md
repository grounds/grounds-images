You can also build these images for your own repository:

    REPOSITORY="tintin" bundle exec rake build

You can also build only a specific image:

    LANGUAGE="ruby" bundle exec rake build

If you do so, please prefix use `REPOSITORY` environment variables for every rake
tasks.

## Get a shell inside an image

    docker run -t grounds/exec-ruby "puts 'Hello world'"
